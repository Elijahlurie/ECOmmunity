# ECOmmunity
A site for people to contribute to stopping climate change in easy ways.
The website will text daily eco-positive actions to users in hopes of them completing them.
- currently includes some code that uses Twilio to send texts to users, but I haven't included the actual files needed to implement Twilio because I may switch to a different platform later.
